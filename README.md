# React JS Resume Web App

![ReactJS Resume Website Template](resume-screenshot.jpg?raw=true "ReactJS Resume Website Template")

## Description

This is a ReactJS based personal resume website template. I have built this by following a Udemy course (credits below) and by beginning with the Ceevee template by Styleshout (credits also below), and breaking up their template into isolated React components. Data is fed directly from a JSON File.
